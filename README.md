# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
#Program to to find the square root for the given number(newton's method) using function.
#Developed by: Jegathish s
#RegisterNumber: 21005410
d=int(input())
def exp():
    x=d**2
    return x
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",exp())
```

## Output:
![exponentiation of a number](expo.png)
![output](exp.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
